                <p class="title">Verse 1:</p>
                <p>I'm going back to a time when we owned this town<br>
                Down Powder Mill Lane, in the battlegrounds<br>
                We were friends and lovers and clueless clowns<br>
                I didn't know I was finding out how I'd be torn from you<br>
                When we talked about things we were gonna do<br>
                We were wide eyed dreamers and wiser too</p>
                
                <p class="title">Chorus 1:</p>
                <p>We'd go down to the rides on East Parade<br>
                By the lights of the Palace Arcade<br>
                And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café</p>
                
                <p class="title">Verse 2:</p>
                <p>I'm begging you for some sign<br>
                But you've still got nothing to say<br>
                Don't turn your back on me, don't walk away<br>
                I'm a better man now than I was that day</p>
                
                <p class="title">Chorus 2:</p>
                <p>Let's go down to the rides on East Parade<br>
                By the lights of the Palace Arcade<br>
                And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café<br>
                Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier<br>
                Watch the drunks and the lovers appear<br>
                To take turns, just as the stars of the Sovereign Light Café</p>
